# murder-mystery
A live-streamed murder mystery game using Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS)

This project requires a Playback URL (that corresponds to a Channel created with Amazon IVS) to placed into its script file. Any metadata sent to this Channel while it is live (via the IVS PutMetadata API) will be rendered on to the notepad underneath the video player.

Enjoy!
